 ## CLASSES VS STRUCTURES

 Imagine you're writing a movie-viewing application in Swift. Users can create lists of movies and share those lists with other users.
 
 Create a `User` and a `List` class that uses reference semantics to help maintain lists between users.
 
 - `User` - Has a method `addList(_:)` which adds the given list to a dictionary of `List` objects (using the `name` as a key), and `list(forName:) -> List?` which will return the `List` for the provided name.
 - `List` - Contains a name and an array of movie titles. A `print` method will print all the movies in the list.
 - Create `jane` and `john` users and have them create and share lists. Have both `jane` and `john` modify the same list and call `print` from both users. Are all the changes reflected?
*/

// TODO: Write solution here
class User {

   var lists: [String: List] = [:]
   
   func addList(_ list: List) {
      lists[list.name] = list
      
   }
   
   func list(forName name: String) -> List? {
      return lists[name]
   }
}

class List {
   var name: String
   var movies: [String] = []
   
   init(name: String) {
      self.name = name
   }
   
   func print() {
      Swift.print("Movie List: \(name)")
      for movie in movies {
         Swift.print(movie)
      }
   }
   
}

let jane = User()
let john = User()

var actionList = List(name: "Action")

jane.addList(actionList)
john.addList(actionList)

jane.lists["Action"]?.movies.append("Rambo")
jane.lists["Action"]?.movies.append("Terminator")

john.lists["Action"]?.movies.append("Die Hard")

john.lists["Action"]?.print()
jane.lists["Action"]?.print()

// Classes can share the same instance. In this case John and Jane shared the same list. When using structs, john and jane had their own unique lists.

 Your challenge here is to imagine a set of objects to support a t-shirt store. Decide if each object should be a class or a struct, and why. You don't need to write any code; just decide whether to use a class or a struct for each.
 
 - `TShirt` - Represents a shirt style you can buy. Each `TShirt` has a size, color, price, and an optional image on the front.
 - `User` - A registered user of the t-shirt store app. A user has a name, email, and a `ShoppingCart` (below).
 - `Address` - Represents a shipping address, containing the name, street, city, and zip code.
 - `ShoppingCart` - Holds a current order, which is composed of an array of `TShirt` that the `User` wants to buy, as well as a method to calculate the total cost. Additionally, there is an `Address` that represents where the order will be shipped.

 */

/*
 Solution:

 - TShirt: A TShirt can be thought of as a value, because it doesn't represent a real shirt, only a description of a shirt. For instance, a TShirt would represent "a large green shirt order" and not "an actual large green shirt". For this reason, TShirt can be a struct instead of a class.
 - User: A User represents a real person. This means every user is unique so User is best implemented as a class.
 - Address: Addresses group multiple values together and two addresses can be considered equal if they hold the same values. This means Address works best as a value type (struct).
 - ShoppingCart: The ShoppingCart is a bit tricker. While it could be argued that it could be done as a value type, it's best to think of the real world semantics you are modeling. If you add an item to a shopping cart, would you expect to get a new shopping cart? Or put the new item in your existing cart? By using a class, the reference semantics help model real world behaviors. Using a class also makes it easier to share a single ShoppingCart object between multiple components of your application (shopping, ordering, invoicing, ...).
